  "name": "Lithuanian Potato-Meat Dumplings (Cepelinai)",
  "description": "Lithuanian potato-meat dumplings are known as zeppelins or cepelinai because of their shape. These hearty and rich dumplings take some time to make, but they are well worth the effort.",
  "ingridients": ["1 pound ground pork, or an equal mix of pork, beef, and veal", "1 medium onion, peeled and finely chopped", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 large egg, beaten", "1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice", "8 large Idaho potatoes, peeled and finely grated, about 5 pounds", "2 large Idaho or Russet potatoes, about 1 1/2 pounds, peeled, boiled, and riced", "1 medium onion, finely grated", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed", "1 tablespoon cornstarch", "1/2 pound bacon, diced ", "1 large onion, coarsely chopped", "1 cup sour cream", "Freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "1 to 2 tablespoons milk, as needed"],
  "preparation": "1. MAKE THE MEAT FILLING: In a large bowl, mix together ground meat, finely chopped onion, the salt, a few grinds of pepper, and the egg until well combined. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. 2 MAKE THE DUMPLINGS: Add the lemon juice to the raw grated potatoes so they don't turn brown. Place them in a fine-mesh cheesecloth or cotton dishtowel, and twist over a large bowl to get rid of the excess water. Pour off the water, reserving the potato starch at the bottom of the bowl. Unwrap the cheesecloth and place the raw potatoes in the bowl with the potato starch you reserved from the bottom of the bowl. Add the cooked riced potatoes, grated onion, and the salt, more to taste. Mix well. Put a large stockpot of well-salted water on to boil. To form the zeppelins, take about 1 cup of dumpling mixture and pat it flat in the palm of the hand. Place 1/4 cup or more of meat mixture in the center and, using slightly dampened hands, fold the potato mixture around the meat into a football shape, sealing well. Continue until both mixtures are used. 3 COOK THE DUMPLINGS: Carefully lower dumplings (in batches if necessary to prevent crowding) into salted, boiling water to which 1 tablespoon of cornstarch has been added (to prevent dumplings from falling apart). Make sure water returns to the boil; reduce the heat to low and continue simmering until the filling is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove dumplings with a slotted spoon or strainer, drain briefly on a clean dish towel and place on a heated platte. 4 MAKE THE GRAVY: While the dumplings are boiling, make the gravy. In a medium skillet, fry the bacon and chopped onion until tender. Drain and combine with sour cream and black pepper. Thin with 1 to 2 tablespoons milk if necessary.Ladle the gravy over the dumplings or pass the gravy at the table."

  "name": "Spicy Honey Garlic Wings",
  "description": "Spicy wings! An all-time favourite ingredient combination, which is honey and garlic, is combined with spicy Korean gochujang and salty soy sauce.",
  "ingridients": ["2 pounds of chicken wings.", "ow-sodium soy sauce", "Vegetable Oil", "Fresh garlic", "Honey sweetens the sauce", "Gochujang sause"],
  "preparation": "Preheat your oven to 450 degrees F.  Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil and set a cooling rack on it. Set that aside. Pat the wings dry with paper towels and transfer them to a mixing bowl with the salt, pepper, and soy sauce. Toss the wings well until coated. Add the cornstarch and toss until all of the wings are well coated. Next, coat the cooling rack with cooking spray and transfer the wings to it. It’s imperative to lay the wings out so that they are not overlapping or even touching for that matter. The space between the wings will encourage faster cooking and more browning. Bake the wings for 40 minutes. Remove them from the oven and use tongs to turn each wing over. Place them back into the oven to bake for 10 more minutes. Once done, remove from oven and set aside. MAKING THE SAUCE: While the wings are baking, measure out the vegetable oil and minced garlic. Get those into a large skillet. Now turn the heat on to medium. Stir and fry the garlic until fragrant. Do not brown the garlic! We are not browning; we are releasing the natural oils and flavour so that the sauce tastes even better. Once the oil starts to sizzle, only cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Next, add the remaining ingredients and whisk until everything is mixed well. Everything goes into that skillet and I whisk everything together until I’m left with a thick, sticky sauce. Add the wings and toss well to coat. Continue to toss over high heat until the sauce thickens even more and the wings are sticky. Plate, and garnish with parsley and sesame seeds. Serve immediately with celery and carrot sticks with your favourite veggie dip.",

  "ingridients": ["Heavy cream ", "Whole milk", "Cane sugar", "Vanilla extract","Salt"],
  "preparation": "At least 12 hours before you want to make homemade ice cream, freeze the bowl of your ice cream maker. It needs to be fully chilled in order for the ice cream to firm up. I recommend doing this step anywhere from 2 to 24 hours in advance. If you do it less than 2 hours ahead, the ice cream won’t thicken as nicely when you churn it.Combine the cream, milk, sugar, vanilla, and salt in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Warm for 5 minutes, whisking often, until the sugar is fully dissolved and the mixture is warmed through. Transfer it to a heatproof bowl, cover, and chill for 2 hours or overnight."

  "ingridients": ["Fresh mint", "White rum", "Fresh lime juice", "Simple syrup", "Club soda or sparkling water", "Ice"],
  "preparation": "First, muddle the mint. Place it in the bottom of a cocktail shaker and use a cocktail muddler to press it until it becomes aromatic. When you’re muddling the mint, your goal isn’t to pulverize it or crush it. Instead, just bruise it slightly to help it release its fragrant oils. This should only take a few taps with your muddler! Second, shake! Add the rum, lime juice, simple syrup, and a handful of ice to the cocktail shaker, and shake it vigorously until the ingredients are completely combined and chilled. Then, strain your mojito. Strain the contents of the cocktail shaker over a glass filled with ice. Top your glass with soda water, and garnish it with lime slices and more fresh mint sprigs. Finally, taste and adjust. This step is essential anytime you’re making a cocktail at home. It gives you a chance to customize your drink to your tastes, finding a balance of flavors you really love. If you prefer a tarter mojito, add an extra squeeze of lime juice. If you want it sweeter, stir in a bit more simple syrup. Not strong enough? Well, you know what to do."
